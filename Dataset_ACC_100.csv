4,4,4,Adaptive Cruise Control,"To use the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system, start by pressing the set speed button on the steering wheel to select your desired speed. The system will then use a combination of radar and camera sensors to detect and track the vehicle ahead, adjusting your speed and distance to maintain a safe gap. As you drive, the ACC system will continuously monitor road conditions, weather, and traffic, and make gentle steering corrections to keep you centered in your lane. If you need to slow down, the system will adjust engine torque and transmission gear shifts to ensure a smooth deceleration. Remember to keep the road surface clear and dry, and avoid driving in heavy rain or snow, as this may affect its performance. Additionally, be aware that the system may not function properly in heavy traffic or construction zones.","It looks like you missed some important details in your initial response:

99,99,99,Adaptive Cruise Control,"To use the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system, start by pressing the ACC button on the steering wheel. Ensure you are driving at a speed of at least 30 km/h on a clear, dry road with moderate to low traffic density. Next, set your desired speed using the button on the steering wheel, and then set your desired distance from the target vehicle. The ACC system will then use a combination of radar, camera, GPS, and IMU data to detect and track the target vehicle, and adjust your vehicle's speed and distance to maintain a safe gap. As you drive, the ACC system will provide auditory feedback through warning tones or voice prompts. If the system detects a fault, it will alert you and take necessary actions. Always keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road, as the ACC system is not a substitute for attentive driving.","It looks like you missed some important details in your initial response:
