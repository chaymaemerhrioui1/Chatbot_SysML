The LKA system uses a monocular camera mounted on the windshield, typically behind the rearview mirror, to capture images of the road ahead. The camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens and a high-dynamic-range (HDR) image sensor to capture clear images in various lighting conditions.\\n2. **Image Processing Unit (IPU)**: The camera sends the captured images to the IPU, which is a dedicated computer that processes the images in real-time to detect the lane markings, road edges, and other relevant features.\\n3. **Lane Detection Algorithm**: The IPU runs a sophisticated lane detection algorithm that analyzes the images to detect the lane markings, including solid and dashed lines, and determines the vehicle's position within the lane.\\n4. **Electric Power Steering (EPS) System**: The LKA system interfaces with the EPS system to provide gentle steering corrections to the driver. The EPS system is typically equipped with a motor, gearbox, and sensors to measure the steering wheel angle and torque.\\n5. **Vehicle Dynamics Control**: The LKA system also interfaces with the vehicle's dynamics control systems, such as the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), to ensure that the steering corrections do not compromise the vehicle's stability or safety.\\n\\n**Operational Steps**\\n\\n1. **System Initialization**: The LKA system is initialized when the vehicle is started, and the camera and IPU are powered up.\\n2. **Lane Detection**: The camera captures images of the road ahead, and the IPU processes the images to detect the lane markings and determine the vehicle's position within the lane.\\n3. **Lane Departure Warning**: If the vehicle drifts out of its lane without a turn signal being activated, the system provides a visual, audible, or haptic warning to the driver.\\n4. **Steering Correction**: If the driver does not respond to the warning, the system provides gentle steering corrections to guide the vehicle back into its lane.\\n5. **System Monitoring**: The LKA system continuously monitors the vehicle's speed, steering angle, and lane position to ensure that the system is operating within its design parameters.\\n\\n**Interactions with Components and Systems**\\n\\n1. **EPS System**: The LKA system interfaces with the EPS system to provide steering corrections to the driver.\\n2. **Vehicle Dynamics Control**: The LKA system interfaces with the vehicle's dynamics control systems, such as ESC and

visual warnings and alerts to the driver.\\n4. **Driver Assistance Systems**: The LKA system may interact with other driver assistance systems, such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Centering, to provide a more comprehensive driver assistance package.\\n5. **Vehicle Network**: The LKA system communicates with other systems on the vehicle network, such as the Body Control Module (BCM) and the Powertrain Control Module (PCM), to share data and coordinate system functions.\\n\\n**Necessary Conditions**\\n\\n1. **Vehicle Speed**: The LKA system typically operates above a minimum speed threshold, such as 40 km/h, to ensure that the system is only active when the vehicle is traveling at a speed where lane departure is more likely to occur.\\n2. **Lane Markings**: The LKA system requires visible lane markings on the road to operate effectively.\\n3. **Driver Attention**: The LKA system assumes that the driver is attentive and aware of the road ahead, and that the system is providing assistance rather than replacing the driver's attention.\\n4. **Road Conditions**: The LKA system is designed to operate on well-maintained roads with clear lane markings and minimal road debris.\\n5. **System Calibration**: The LKA system requires periodic calibration to ensure that the camera and IPU are properly aligned and configured.\\n\\n**User Interface and Controls**\\n\\n1. **Warning Lights**: The LKA system may display warning lights on the dashboard or instrument cluster to alert the driver of a lane departure.\\n2. **Audible Alerts**: The LKA system may provide audible alerts, such as a beep or chime, to alert the driver of a lane departure.\\n3. **Haptic Feedback**: The LKA system may provide haptic feedback, such as a vibrating steering wheel or seat, to alert the driver of a lane departure.\\n4. **System Enable/Disable**: The driver may be able to enable or disable the LKA system using a switch or button on the dashboard.\\n5. **System Settings**: The driver may be able to adjust the system's sensitivity and alert thresholds using the infotainment system or a dedicated menu.\\n\\n**Fault Detection and Management**\\n\\n1. **Camera Obstruction**: The LKA system may detect camera obstruction, such as dirt or snow, and alert the driver to clean the camera.\\n2. **IPU Failure**: The LKA system may detect IPU failure and alert the driver to seek service.\\n3. **EPS System Failure**: The LKA system may detect EPS system failure and alert the driver to seek service.\\n4. **Lane Marking Detection Failure**: The LKA system may
